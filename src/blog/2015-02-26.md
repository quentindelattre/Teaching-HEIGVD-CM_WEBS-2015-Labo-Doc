Implementation of the API in Heroku is done.

About the implementation of Actions and its relations within the Issues, we had some concerns. We know that it is useful to have access to the whole actions history, but we figured that the association between an issue and its actions was more complex than that.

We thought that it was an aggregate association in a sense that the actions have no meaning on their own if they are not associated with an issue. However, we still needed to have access to them all regardless of the issue.

Therefore, we implemented this attribute in both ways. Upon creating an action, which can only be executed through a POST request at the following path « /api/issues/:id/actions », the action is pushed in the issue.actions array, which is an array of Actions objects. In the same process, the object is also stored to be accessed with a GET request at the following path : « /api/actions ».

We figured this was the most complete way of managing issues and their actions.
